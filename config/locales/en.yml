# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

      invitation: "The risk of infection in a childcare facility does not spare the workers. Studies had proven that a large proportion of daycare staff is women in their childbearing age. During their gestation period, their body's immune system undergoes several changes that results to a weak immune system.

      slide_header_0_content: The ultimate resource for childcare operators who are committed to safeguarding the health of children under their care.
      slide_header_1_content: Did you know that children in daycare are three times more likely to get infected? In such close proximity of each other, one child’s illness can rapidly spread through the entire group.
      slide_header_1_subcontent: With the Health Preserving Care Program, you can provide children with the nurturing, safer, and healthier childcare setting they deserve.
      slide_header_2_content: Studies show that the majority of daycare staff are women in their childbearing years. During pregnancy, the immune system undergoes several changes and becomes compromised.
      slide_header_2_subcontent: This increases the risk of harmful infection to expectant mothers. You owe it to the staff under your supervision to give them the very best protection against infection.
      slide_header_3_content: Parents of children exposed to illnesses with regularity are expected to take time off work to care for them. This results in a loss of earnings at best, or at worst, disciplinary proceedings against them.
      slide_header_3_subcontent: Together, we can stop the spread of infection at source. Find out more about how you can play your part.
      slide_header_4_content: When children face illness regularly, parents have to take time off from work to care for them. Taking time off from work means a loss of income, or at worst, facing redundancy. Together, we can fight the spread of infections at their source.
      slide_header_4_subcontent: Find out how you can play your part below.
      start_here_1: Daycare centers are a breeding ground for bacterial and viral infections.
      start_here_2: Discover the top hidden health risks for the children and employees of your daycare facility, and learn how to effectively mitigate the risk of infection for the children and childcare staff under your care.

      title: You’re just 3 steps away from being part of The Health Preserving Accreditation
      description: Our health-preserving accreditation program includes six interconnected areas of infection risk exposure children and staff face, plus a clear, effective infection prevention protocol to help your facility mitigate theses risks.

    mission_step:
      promo_header: Keeping children, childcare workers, and parents free from harm.
      promo_text: Childcare environments are a breeding ground for bacterial and viral infections. We owe it to our children to give them the safest and healthiest start to life.
      promo_subhead: Breeding ground for childhood infections with potential long­term damage
      intro_1: or childcare facilities and their operators, understanding the cause of infections running rampant through daycare centers isn’t difficult. Poor hygiene habits among children, combined with their susceptibility to illness and greater crowding, makes sickness a constant challenge.
      intro_2: This, of course, leads to higher infection rates among children attending daycare facilities ­ a fact documented by researchers for decades.
      scientific_fact: Scientific Fact
      fact_1: Wald et al found that children attending child care centers had a 51% higher rate of infection, and 134% more days of illness as compared to children cared for at home.
      fact_2: Swedish children in child care required 40 to 80% more medical consultations for acute infections than other children who remained at home.
      fact_3: A Danish study reported a 69% higher incidence of hospitalizations among children in daycare for acute respiratory infection compared with children in home care.
      children_risk: Health Risks to Children
      children_risk_1: The negative health effects of childhood infection can extend beyond the initial acute phase of illness. Although, in the majority of cases, infections resolve without interfering with later development, the consequences of increased poor health are not so simple.
      children_risk_2: Respiratory infections and obstructed airways are a major cause of hospitalization and morbidity in small children and can lead to reduced lung function among children later in life.
      children_risk_3: Otitis media ­ or middle ear infection ­ can have adverse consequences in children under 3 years old even when treated properly, including reduced reading comprehension and compromised cognitive ability. Daycare attendance has been cited as one of the leading risk factors for the onset of middle ear infection.
      children_risk_4: Children who attend daycare also have an increased risk of urgent medical attention as a result of rotavirus infection. Rotaviruses are thought to be responsible for between 20% and 60% of hospital admissions in children.
      children_risk_5: Additionally, varicella ­ a cause of chickenpox and shingles ­ is often considered a benign childhood disease, but can result in complications as serious as hospitalization or even death.
      staff_parents_risk: Health Risks to Childcare Staff & Parents
      staff_parents_risk_1: Infectious diseases are, by definition, transmitted from person­to­person. The increased risk of infection within childcare facilities extends far beyond the children in attendance, and puts adults in contact with them at greater risk too.
      staff_parents_risk_2: Working in the childcare sector carries significant occupational risk for caregivers, including exposure to diseases like Hepatitis A, CMV, Influenza, Tuberculosis, Meningitis, Scabies, Pediculosis, and Herpes.
      staff_parents_risk_3: A 1996 cross­sectional study found that 62% of childcare workers had contracted CMV; the majority of whom were of childbearing age. The risk of infection from children under their care is of serious concern, especially for those who may be pregnant.
      staff_parents_risk_4: CMV is a leading cause of congenital infection transmitted by preschool children to their peers, parents, and caregivers. Babies born with the virus may suffer central nervous system abnormalities, growth restrictions, and jaundice. Up to 90% of young CMV survivors endure serious long­term health issues, including visual impairment and decreased neurological function.
      next_step_header: 'Next step : mitigate risk in your facility and show you care'
      next_step_text: Just as researchers have clarified the risk of increased infection rates in childcare facilities, they have also recognized that control measures to reduce the spread of infectious diseases is imperative.
      mission_invite: To that end, the Health Preserving Care Standard was developed to enable you to utilize the most optimal infection control standards & practices to effectively mitigate the risk of infection in your facility.

    standard_step:
      heading_1: Create the healthiest environment for your children and staff
      content_1_a: Given the preponderance of risk factors in childcare settings, we have developed The Standard of health-preserving care. When you use it in your facility, your entire daycare community will cultivate a deep understanding of the risks of infectious diseases in childcare environments. They’ll also be professionally trained to utilize effective and trackable measures to control and prevent disease transmission.  By receiving HSCA accreditation, you’ll be operating your facility according to the health-preserving practices set forth in The Standard—the highest possible standard of illness and disease prevention there is in the daycare setting.
      heading_2: Decrease in Absenteeism
      content_2_a: Operating your childcare facility according to The Standard also helps decrease or eliminate the risk of ongoing infection and absenteeism. You know all too well that these factors can drain your childcare of productivity.
      heading_3: Potential growth of your facility
      content_3_a: Conforming to The Standard is likely to motivate discerning parents to seek out and select your childcare for their children, which would result in the growth or your facility.
      heading_4: Raising the national standard and creating healthier, happier childcare
      content_4_a: Each time a childcare facility becomes HSCA accredited, it raises the global benchmark of health-preserving care. We’re proud to be leading this transformation, and we’d like you to join us in our journey. With our accreditation program, you’ll be a key component in a nationwide movement to create a higher standard for our children—and avoid debilitating sickness, harm and suffering… for your staff, the children under your care, and parents. To find out how you can be one of the first daycare facilities to raise your standards against infection, click on the button below. When you become accredited, you will show parents you’re the only childcare center in your area qualified to practice higher safety standards for the health and well-being of their children.
